Travel to the west and find yourself in an organic tropical farm you didn’t know existed in Singapore. Bring the kids along for an educational trip where you’ll see various fruits and vegetables grown here. After exploring the farm, whet your appetite at Poison Ivy Bistro – where the vegetables and herbs are freshly grown from the garden. You’ll find local delights such as Nasi Lemak, Laksa and kueh-mueh.
